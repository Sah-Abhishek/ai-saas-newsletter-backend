Streaming platforms like Netflix and Prime Video are set to debut new titles, including 'Baaghi 4,' 'Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra,' and horror sequels 'IT: Welcome to Derry' and 'M3GAN 2.0.' In a surprising move, President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, framing it as a rebuke to the Biden administration's crypto policies. Meanwhile, a Brown University study exposed AI chatbots for systematically violating mental health ethics through 'deceptive empathy.' Political ethics remain in focus as a bipartisan group of lawyers raised alarms over Trump's reported demand for $230 million in legal fee reimbursements, while the New York Times identified the anonymous donor who paid $130 million to military personnel during a past government shutdown. International relations saw Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim urging ASEAN nations to forge new and deepen existing partnerships amidst rising protectionism. Domestically, discussions around Secret Service reform, academic progression, and fostering next-generation researchers in Malaysia highlight critical societal challenges.\",\n  \"quiz\": [\n    {\n
